Please complete the report problem below:

## Problem 1
Provide your profitable path, the amountIn, amountOut value for each swap, and your final reward (your tokenB balance).

> Solution
> Swap(B,A) amountIn:4.151608877446016 amountOut:4.987231595204996
Swap(A,E) amountIn:4.987231595204996 amountOut:0.9595542289555015
Swap(E,D) amountIn:0.9595542289555015 amountOut:2.2178059464947353
Swap(D,C) amountIn:2.2178059464947353 amountOut:4.679637536566986
Swap(C,A) amountIn:4.679637536566986 amountOut:19.409445452839083

>Be aware that I still have 5-4.151608877446016 = 0.848391122553984 in my balance before the last swap. Thus I have 20.257836575393068 units of tokenB in the end.
